## Open Space

This is an example on how to describe the open space format. Note that you might want to add information about food, sponsors, etc.

```txt
This meetup will be in the format of Open Space where you are part of setting the agenda!
We will start out with an introduction to Open Space and then move on to generating topics. Everyone gets to write down their suggested topics, one per post-it, and put them up on the whiteboard/wall. We will then vote on the sessions (each attendee gets a limited number of votes). We have X rooms available at the venue, meaning we can have X sessions in parallel, so once the voting is done we will distribute the topics over these rooms.
The schedule will be:
- Introduction to Open Space (~5 minutes)
- Topic generation (~20 minutes)
- Voting (~10 minutes)
- Session Block 1 (~45 minutes)
- Break (~15 minutes)
- Session Block 2 (~45 minutes)
So bring whatever topic you feel passionate about and let's meet for an evening of great discussions!
```
