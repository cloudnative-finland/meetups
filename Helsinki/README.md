### Description

We host talks from anyone doing incredible things with Kubernetes, and the other CNCF technologies, including companies using them in production or vendors pushing the boundaries of what the cloud native techs can do.

Presentations will be focused on introduction slides, guides, workshops, adoption stories, and demos, but not sales pitches. The meetup will be organized in an open and democratic way, where anyone that wants to help out with organizing or speaking will be genuinely welcome.

To become an organizer or speaker, please reach out to us!

This meetup's official language is English; the conversations and presentations will be in English.
